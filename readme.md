Hello! This is a To-Do list app that allows the user to add items to:
    - add items to their list
    - view all items on list
    - mark items as complete
    - remove items from list

The app is very descriptive in instructions and user friendly!

The app starts off with a menu of options:

     Welcome to the To-Do List App!

        Menu:
        1. Add a task
        2. View tasks
        3. Mark a task as complete
        4. Delete a task
        5. Quit

When adding a task, you will be asked if you'd like to add more items. Simply 
reply with y for yes or n for no. The app is not case sensitive by the way!

When marking a task as complete please do not abbreviate your task! Type it in
as entered on list. Same goes for deleting a task! 
(REMINDER app is not case sensitive). 

When marking task as complete, when you go to view the list the completed task 
will have [x] at the end of the task description.
